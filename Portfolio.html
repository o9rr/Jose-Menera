       <p class="sans">Welcome to my portfolio <br>
	   I live in Fresno,California and I'm a student at edison high school.<br>
	  In my school i go to a class about computers.<br>
	In the class we did alot of projects about code and I'm going to show them to you in here in my web<br>
	Lightbot:<br>
	Lightbot is the first coding programing game that we started in the beginingto get used of codeing.<br>
	<img src="lightbot.jpg"/></p>  
	Then we did a program called scratch which gave us a better understanding of codeing.<br>
	It was easy and kidfriendly. Then we created our own game and made a copy of another game and change it as much as we can.
