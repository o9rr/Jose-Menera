       <p class="sans">Welcome to my portfolio <br>
	   I live in Fresno,California and I'm a student at edison high school.<br>
	  In my school i go to a class about computers.<br>
	In the class we did alot of projects about code and I'm going to show them to you in here in my web<br>
	Lightbot:<br>
	Lightbot is the first coding programing game that we started in the beginingto get used of codeing.<br>

	Then we did a program called scratch which gave us a better understanding of codeing.<br>
	It was easy and kidfriendly. Then we created our own game and made a copy of another game and change it as much as we can.<br>

	After scratch we made a app in this site called appinventor. We created a app with two other group members.<br>
	Then we presented the app to the class room and explained how it can be used in real life.<br>

	Then we tried khan academy.<br>
	Khan academy is a website that teaches you how to code step by step.<br>

	Then the teacher introduced us to notepad++.<br>
	We used notepad++ to create our first websites.<br>
	<img src="notepad.jpg"/>  <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/"target="_blank">Notepad++</a>
	The last website that we are still curently using is git hub.<br>
	Git hub is exactly the same as notepad++ but this you can easilly send someone your link and they can access your web site easier.<br>
	I say that git hub is better cause it makes it easier to make a website and unleash your imagination.<br>
